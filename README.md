# 👩‍💻 Srushti’s Internet Corner

Welcome! You’ve landed in my little corner of the internet where  
**code meets curiosity and systems meet storytelling** ✨

I’m **Srushti** (aka *Decoder Damsel*) - a backend-leaning engineer and grad student at the University of Washington who enjoys:
- digging into how systems *actually* work,
- building things that scale (and don’t fall over under pressure),
- and occasionally overthinking design decisions just enough to make them elegant.
